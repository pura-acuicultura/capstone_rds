# capstone_rds
User defined project for HarvardX Data Science Capstone

The project consists of 3x files:

bllc_capstone_report.pdf
bllc_capstone_scripts.R
bllc_capstone_report.Rmd

"bllc_capstone_scripts.R" was created in R version 4.5.0 and RStudio/2025.05.0+496. The file will run without error but please note:

- 10 packages will be installed if not already existing
- To download the dataset directly from Kaggle, a fine-grained personal access token will need to be obtained and present in the working drive as "kaggle.json". If you don't know how to do this, read the "Authentication" section at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api
